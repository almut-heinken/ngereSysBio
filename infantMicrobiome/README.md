This repository contains all scripts and data needed to reproduce the analyses in Shaaban et al.

Please run the script ""RunAll" to execute all analyses and simulations that require MATLAB.
The simulations were run in MATLAB version 2020b, which is recommended.
Scripts need to be run in the order they appear in RunAll.m.

Software requirements:
- COBRA Toolbox (https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox)
- IBM CPLEX solver
- Parallel Computing Toolbox, Bioinformatics Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox in MATLAB

Afterwards, run the scripts in the folder "R_scripts" in any order to generate the remaining figures. 
R version 4.3.0 with RStudio had been used in the paper.
