# üìÅ Results ‚Äî SIRT1 Regulatory Modeling

This directory contains all output data, simulation results, and figures generated by scripts and notebooks in the `iSIRT1_regulatoryModeling` project.

Each subfolder corresponds to a distinct modeling focus or analysis domain (e.g., Caco-2 cells, dietary simulations, infant microbiome, FVA plots).

## Folder Overview

### `1CM/`
- Contains SRFBA results from a **single context-specific model** simulation.
- **File**: `srFBA.csv` ‚Äî fluxes under different SIRT1 levels.
- Source: `notebook/1CM_fva_srFBA.ipynb`.

---

### `caco2/`
- All analyses related to the **Caco-2 colon cell line**.
  - `fva_simulations/`: FVA results across butyrate doses.
  - `robustness/`: Statistical outputs (e.g. p-values, effect sizes).
  - `metabolite_plots/`, `metabolite_plots_full/`: Individual metabolite visualizations.
- Source notebooks: `caco2_robustness_analysis.ipynb`, `butyrate_infant_colon_models.ipynb`.

---

### `diets_fba_heatmap/`
- PCA plots, clustering, and diet comparison simulations.
- Source: `diet_models_robustness_FBA.ipynb`.

---

### `fluxes_spearman_nonzero/`
- Pathway-specific **Spearman correlation analyses** between SIRT1 levels and fluxes.
- Subfolders named by **metabolic subsystems** (e.g., `Glycolysis`, `Citric acid cycle`).
- Source: `tissue_cs_models_fba_analysis.ipynb` or related scripts.

---

### `fva/`
- General FVA outputs from models across conditions.
- Raw or summarized flux bounds (min/max).

---

### `fva_figure2/`
- Final figure components (e.g., panels) used in **Figure 2** of the manuscript.
- Likely includes curated plots from FVA and pathway analysis.

---

### `fva_plots/`
- Large library of **pathway-level FVA visualizations**.
- Includes plots like violin plots, flux spread maps, etc.
- Subfolders grouped by KEGG/Reactome pathway name.

---

### `infant_microbiome/`
- Outputs from **infant colon SRFBA simulations** using real microbiome & SIRT1 data.
- Includes:
  - `butyrate_sirt1_regression.png`
  - Possibly `SIRT1`-based flux matrices or correlations.
- Source: `infant_microbiome_colon_srFBA.ipynb`.

## Notes
- This folder is meant for **output only** ‚Äî all generation logic is handled via `/notebook/` or `/code/`.
- Figures were moved from `/notebook/` to here for clarity and publication readiness.
- Folder structure follows an **analysis domain-based** organization.
